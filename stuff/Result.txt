Triple talaq: Penal law in sync with past ones on social evils
NEW DELHI: The Centre's bill to make instant triple talaq a criminal offence may have attracted criticism that marriage is a civil contract and breaches therein should not invite penal consequences, but the legislation appears in sync with the Supreme Court's August 22 ruling declaring instant oral talaq to be "manifestly arbitrary".The SC had said: "Triple talaq is only a form of talaq which is permissible in law, but at the same time, stated to be sinful by the very Hanafi school which tolerates it... Triple talaq forms no part of Article 25 (which guarantees right to profess a religion of choice).So, the argument of political parties that triple talaq was a religious issue was rejected by the SC.Since triple talaq has been declared unlawful, Muslim women can also complain under Section 498A against husbands if the bill fails to become law because of opposition by political parties.This tells us that even if the SC declared triple talaq unconstitutional, the practice will continue in the absence of penal consequences.
